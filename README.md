# BitmapCompilerPython

This is a project for which the idea I had quite some time ago.
It takes a bitmap file (currently only 24 bit bitmaps supported) and creates an executable according to "code" encoded in the bitmap.
It is not practical at all, yet I plan to add some more features (there are many lacking, even simple arithmetic operations aren't implemented).

I apologise for my python, it is my first non "hello world" project in this language. The code is not organized at all (might work on that later).
I just had to write a program in python, so I took the opportunity to create this abomination.

This repository is under GNU GPL.

I do not plan on adding support for any other operating systems/executable formats - it's just a silly ptoject I had in mind and I have no knowledge on *nix executable formats - this project certainly won't be the one, which pushes me to learning about them.
